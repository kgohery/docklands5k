              The race will be held on Thursday, July 11th, starting at 7:45pm.
              The race starts on the South Docks near Lime Street which is very
              near to the Samuel Beckett Bridge - that's the one almost opposite
              the Convention Centre. From there you will head towards the City
              Centre all the way to the Matt Talbot Bridge which you will cross
              over to the North Quay. From there you will run all the way down
              to the 3 Arena where you will loop back down the North Quay again
              towards the Matt Talbot Bridge. There you will cross the Bridge
              again and back to the South Quay. From there you will run back
              past the start line. The finish line is approx. 750 metres beyond
              the start line and you will finish at Capital Dock on Sir John
              Rogerson's Quay. You are then just a small stroll away from the
              bag drop area in Capital Dock Square and that well deserved night
              out!!

          <p>
            The assembly area for the event will be on the City Quay between the
            start line (located on City Quay next to HubSpot House) and the
            southern end of the Samuel Beckett Bridge (at the junction with
            Cardiff Lane and City Quay).
            <strong
              >Please ensure that you enter the start section corresponding to
              your expected finishing time</strong
            >. Your time zone location will be facilitated by the presence of
            pacing groups (20 mins, 25 mins and 30 mins) and, in order to avoid
            impeding faster runners, please do not assemble in a zone that would
            be ahead of your likely finishing time. You are expected to assemble
            in this area at the latest 20 minutes before the start of the race
            (i.e. 19:25).

            will be available at the finish line. Please do not discard empty
            water bottles or any other litter in the street. There will be bins
            provided for the purpose. Please use them.
          </p>

          <p>
            This will follow as soon as possible after the lead competitors have

          <p>
            The race will be held on Thursday, July 11th, starting at 7:45pm.
            The race starts on the South Docks at HubSpot House which is near to
            the Samuel Beckett Bridge - that's the one almost opposite the
            Convention Centre. From there you will head towards the City Centre
            all the way to the Matt Talbot Bridge which you will cross over to
            the North Quay. From there you will run all the way down to the 3
            Arena where you will loop back down the North Quay again towards the
            Matt Talbot Bridge. There you will cross the Bridge again and back
            to the South Quay. From there you will run back past the start line.
            The finish line is approx. 750 metres beyond the start line and you
            will finish at Sir John Rogerson's Quay. You are then just a small
            stroll away from the bag drop area in Capital Dock Square and that
            well deserved night out!!

        <a class="question"> AND WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO? </a>
        <div class="answer money">
          <h5>The Short Answer</h5>
          <p>
            We, Crusaders Athletic Club, are investing ALL the proceeds from the
            race into providing much needed sporting facilities to serve the
            Docklands Community in our HQ at Irishtown Stadium. So, money from
            the community will be invested back into the community.
          </p>
          <h5>The Slightly Longer Answer</h5>
          <p>
            The Docklands area is a vibrant and growing area. Indeed the
            Docklands has been designated as a Strategic Development Zone (SDZ)
            which envisages a large rise of some 25,000 people in both the
            working and residential population in the Docklands during the next
            few years as more companies set up in the area. This will give rise
            to a requirement for more residential living space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recreation plays a very important role in our lives. The Docklands
            area boasts a magnificent sports arena in Irishtown Stadium. There
            is not only a full 8 lane athletics track but also a fully equipped
            gym, all-weather 11-a side (which is also used for Tag Rugby),
            all-weather 5 a side pitches along with shower and changing room
            facilities all available and open to the public.
          </p>
          <p>
            Crusaders Athletic Club (founded 1942) invested heavily in the
            construction of Irishtown Stadium in the early 2000's with the
            remainder being financed by Dublin City Council (DCC). Crusaders, as
            a result of this investment, are the anchor tenant in the stadium
            which is managed by DCC and open to all. Moreover, in 2021 we
            completed the building of a state-of-the-art clubhouse at the
            stadium, containing, for training purposes, a 40-metres indoor
            track, which will continue to enable us to offer a high level of
            support to the athletic community, including schools in the area.
            The offering of the facilities in Irishtown Stadium to both
            residents and local companies' employees has seen our membership
            grow to 700 members in 2023. We thus provide a crucial role in the
            Docklands community providing a healthy and worthwhile recreational
            activity to all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Crusaders Athletic Club will use all the proceeds from the event to
            further enhance the sport facilities in the stadium to cater for the
            growing demand which will be placed upon the facilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            So money from the Community raised through the Docklands 5k is
            invested back into the Community!! We hope you agree that this is a
            very worthwhile cause and one where you and many others will
            directly benefit.
