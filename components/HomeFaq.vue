        race starts on the South Docks near Lime Street which is very near to
        the Samuel Beckett Bridge - that's the one almost opposite the

        Quay. From there you will run all the way down to the 3 Arena where you
        will loop back down the North Quay again towards the Matt Talbot Bridge.
        There you will cross the Bridge again and back to the South Quay. From
        there you will run back past the start line. You will finish at Capital
        Dock on Sir John Rogersonâ€™s Quay. You are then just a small stroll away
        from the bag drop area in the Capital Dock Square etc

    <a class="question" @click="toggleAnswer('money')">
      AND WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?
    </a>

    <div class="answer money">
      <h5>The Short Answer</h5>

      <p>
        We, Crusaders Athletic Club, are investing ALL the proceeds from the
        race into providing much needed sporting facilities to serve the
        Docklands Community in our HQ at Irishtown Stadium. So, money from the
        community will be invested back into the community.
      </p>

      <h5>The Slightly Longer Answer</h5>

      <p>
        The Docklands area is a vibrant and growing area. Indeed the Docklands
        has been designated as a Strategic Development Zone (SDZ) which
        envisages a large rise of some 25,000 people in both the working and
        residential population in the Docklands during the next few years as
        more companies set up in the area. This will give rise to a requirement
        for more residential living space.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recreation plays a very important role in our lives. The Docklands area
        boasts a magnificent sports arena in Irishtown Stadium. There is not
        only a full 8 lane athletics track but also a fully equipped gym,
        all-weather 11-a side (which is also used for Tag Rugby), all-weather 5
        a side pitches along with shower and changing room facilities all
        available and open to the public.
      </p>

      <p>
        Crusaders Athletic Club (founded 1942) invested heavily in the
        construction of Irishtown Stadium in the early 2000's with the remainder
        being financed by Dublin City Council (DCC). Crusaders, as a result of
        this investment, are the anchor tenant in the stadium which is managed
        by DCC and open to all. Moreover, in 2021 we completed the building of a
        state-of-the-art clubhouse at the stadium, containing, for training
        purposes, a 40-metres indoor track, which will continue to enable us to
        offer a high level of support to the athletic community, including
        schools in the area. The offering of the facilities in Irishtown Stadium
        to both residents and local companies' employees has seen our membership
        grow to 500 members in 2021. We thus provide a crucial role in the
        Docklands community providing a healthy and worthwhile recreational
        activity to all.
      </p>

      <p>
        Crusaders Athletic Club will use all the proceeds from the event to
        further enhance the sport facilities in the stadium to cater for the
        growing demand which will be placed upon the facilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        So money from the Community raised through the Docklands 5k is invested
        back into the Community!! We hope you agree that this is a very
        worthwhile cause and one where you and many others will directly
        benefit.
