      <h4>Baggage Drop Off</h4>
      <p>
        The location of the baggage area is Capital Dock Square. You will be
        provided with a bag tag at drop-off.
        <strong
          >Please write on the tag your race number that you will be given at
          registration and attach it to your bag</strong
        >. Pens will be provided. Give the bag to the steward and it will be
        placed in number sequence so that it can be easily recovered after the
        race.
      </p>
      <p>
        For security purposes you will be required to show your race number in
        order to recover your bag. Please do not leave valuables in your bag.
        Whilst the race organisers will make every effort to ensure the
        safekeeping of your bag, no responsibility can be accepted for loss of
        personal effects.
      </p>

      <h4>Access to the Start line</h4>
      <p>
        The assembly area for the event will be on the City Quay between the
        Start line (located at the junction of Lime Street and City Quay) and
        the southern end of the Samuel Beckett Bridge (at the junction with
        Cardiff Lane and City Quay).
        <strong
          >Please ensure that you enter the start section corresponding to your
          expected finishing time</strong
        >. Your time zone location will be facilitated by the presence of pacing
        groups (20 mins, 25 mins and 30 mins) and, in order to avoid impeding
        faster runners, please do not assemble in a zone that would be ahead of
        your likely finishing time. You are expected to assemble in this area at
        the latest 20 minutes before the start of the race (i.e. 19:25).
        <strong
          >Please follow the instructions of stewards and pacers at all
          times</strong
        >.

          >Please pin your race number bib with the safety pins provided on the
          front of your singlet/shirt and do not interfere with the timing chip
          which is contained in the bib. It is up to you to provide emergency
          contact information and we suggest you provide this by writing the
          details on the back of your race number bib.</strong

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Because this is a chip-timed event, your individual time will be
          recorded only from when you cross the start line to when you cross the
          finishing line</strong
        >.
      </p>
      <h4>At the Finish</h4>
      <p>
        After you cross the finish line please keep moving and follow the
        instructions of the stewards who will direct you towards the water and
        refreshment pick-up on your way back to the baggage area. Water will be
        available at the finish line. Please do not discard empty water bottles
        or any other litter in the street. There will be bins provided for the
        purpose. Please use them.
      </p>
      <h4>Prize-giving</h4>
      <p>
        Prizes will be presented to the “top finishers” and the first teams
        across the line on the night, as well as the winning club teams. We
        haven’t determined the depth of top finishers or the amount of prize
        money just yet. Age category and 2nd and 3rd placed (non-club) team
        prizes will be mailed out after the event.
